Git:

vim is a modal editor, type or move, not both: i for insert, m for move

cli prompt is bit before you command 3 parts:
    who user is, ..., ...
ls - show files  (-a includes hidden)

commits are like a save state of a file

git init - initialise repository
git status - summary of whats going on .
git add [file] - track to (. commits all in pwd, avoid . as includes unnecessary files)
