Git:

vim is a modal editor, type or move, not both: i for insert, m for move

cli prompt is bit before you command 3 parts:
    who user is, ..., ...
ls - show files  (-a includes hidden)
-h on a command gives you help

commits are like a save state of a file
git understands three trees:
    index/working area: directory tree on user machine
    staging area: directory tree of changes not yet commited
    commits area: timelines of committed versions

Head is a pointer to latest commit BLA BLA BLA remove plz

- Restore: (CHILL) restores files in working area to their last versions added to the staging area
- Revert: (RISKY) reverts files in working area to the last commited versions, need commit id
- Reset: (DANGEROUS) 5 versions, it affects the commit history (which can be confusing), restores to a given commit and truncates history to this point
        (--mixed) acts as if add has taken place
        (--hard) take me to a point in history, destroy all history after that point
git init - initialise repository
git status - summary of whats going on .
git add [file] - track to (. commits all in pwd, avoid . as includes unnecessary files)
git log - shows changes (--oneline for better output)
git restore - see above, (--staged basically empties staging area)
git revert - see above
git reset [commit-id] = (--soft) is chill version
